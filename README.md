### Project Description
concept of finding food recipes based on ingredients and explore a delightful variety of recipes across three exciting categories:authentic Kerala delicacies,nutritious diet-based dishes and kid-friendly favorites.

### The Problem statement
1. Lack of Personalization:
Existing recipe platforms often fail to cater to unique dietary requirements, ingredient availability, making it difficult for users to find suitable recipes.
2. Ingredient Waste:
People frequently throw away unused ingredients due to the lack of recipes that match what they already have at home.
3. Time Constraints:
Busy schedules often prevent users from experimenting with new recipes, meal planning, or exploring cooking options.

### The Solution
1.Customization:
Easily tailor recipes to personal preferences, dietary restrictions, or ingredient availability.
2. Time-Saving:
Generate recipes quickly by inputting available ingredients, avoiding the need to search manually.
3. Improved Nutritional Intake:
Ensures a balanced diet rich in essential vitamins, minerals, and nutrients.
4. Enhances Energy and Activity Levels:
Provides the right balance of carbohydrates, proteins, and fats to keep kids active and energetic.
